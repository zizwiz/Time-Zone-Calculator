# Time-Zone-Calculator
This small app will get the timezone information from your OS. 

It will then show some stats about the zone you are in, like daylight saving etc. 

It will allow you to choose a different zone and show the time at present in that zone. 

It will also allow you to find a different date and time in the zone you choose and will work it out in respect of where you are. 

The timezone you choose will be remembered when you close the app and restart it.
